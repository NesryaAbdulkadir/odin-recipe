    <p>
      These tasty cocktail meatballs will disappear quickly at your holiday
      party. My mom makes them every year for New Year's Eve, and now so do I.
      These do very well in a slow cooker, as you can simmer them before serving
      and keep them hot for the duration of your party.These sausage balls are
      as good as Bisquick sausage balls, but without the carbs and gluten. They
      are also keto friendly! Eat them fresh out of the oven or refrigerate or
      freeze for later use.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound bulk spicy pork sausage</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons coconut flour</li>

      <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages unflavored gelatin</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine sausage, Cheddar cheese, almond flour, coconut flour, gelatin,
        egg, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix to combine using your hands,
        a stand mixer, or a food processor. Form mixture into uniformly-sized
        balls (about 1 ½-inch diameter) and place on the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 23 to 28 minutes.
        Remove sausage balls and let cool on the pan until oil is reabsorbed,
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
